# voeventdb      [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timstaley/voeventdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timstaley/voeventdb)

A database-store and accompanying RESTful query API for archiving and retrieving 
[VOEvent](http://voevent.readthedocs.org/) packets.

## Docs [![Documentation Status](http://readthedocs.org/projects/voeventdb/badge/?version=latest)](http://voeventdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)
voeventdb comes with a full set of 
documentation, available at http://voeventdb.readthedocs.org.
If you're new to voeventdb, or have never even heard of a VOEvent, start
with the 
[introduction page](http://voeventdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview/intro.html).

## License
GPL v2 (see [licence file](COPYING.txt)). This package is GPL by necessity due
to use of the 'q3c' spatial-query library. If circumstances warrant it, another
spatial query engine could perhaps be swapped in and a re-licensing arranged,
but I don't see that being likely anytime soon.

## Acknowledgement
If you'd like to use voeventdb (or the REST API provided at 
http://voeventdb.4pisky.org/) for work leading to a publication then I would 
appreciate you getting in touch so that I can arrange a suitable 
[ASCL](http://ascl.net/) entry or other DOI for citing.
